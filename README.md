# Datepicker that doesn't corrupt your data

Prehistory
One day I needed a datepicker. My application was developed on the basis of jQuery and Bootstrap, so I looked for widgets for them. I tested two of them, and found that when initiating both of them corrupted my data ("data-" attrubutes). So, I decided to develop a simple script that will be as tolerate to other code as possible.
