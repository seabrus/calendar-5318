# Datepicker that doesn't corrupt your data

Prehistory<br>
One day I needed a datepicker. My application was developed on the basis of jQuery and Bootstrap, so I looked for widgets for them. I tested two of them, and found that when initiating both of them corrupted my data ("data-" attrubutes). So, I decided to develop a simple script that will be as tolerate to other code as possible.

Calendar 5318 is that script. It's a simple datepicker and help the user to choose a necessary date in a form or elsewhere else.

The package includes the following files:
- index.html -- it illustrates how to add Calendar 5318 into HTML code and is the starting file for demo
- css/*.css -- they defines how the calendar looks. Please note that there are used such things as "calc", so in some browsers you have to modify css code (a possible solution is given as a comment)
- js/*.js -- code of the Calendar class and calendar event handlers
